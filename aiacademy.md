# TDGS AI Academy

You have been given a zip file containing the complete Tactical Dice Game System (TDGS) documentation. Your task is to learn this system thoroughly by reading the documentation in a specific order.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Discover the File Structure

List all directories and files in this archive. The structure follows this pattern:
- Root (`/`) contains global documents
- `/core` contains core system documents (human-readable)
- `/core/forai` contains core system documents (AI-optimized)
- `/extensions` contains extension documents (human-readable)
- `/extensions/forai` contains extension documents (AI-optimized)
- `/supplemental` contains supplemental documents (human-readable)
- `/supplemental/forai` contains supplemental documents (AI-optimized)
- `/forai` contains global AI-optimized documents

### Step 2: Read Foundation Documents

Read these root-level files first, in this order:
1. `intent.md` - Understand the design philosophy and goals
2. `conventions.md` - Learn the documentation standards and terminology
3. `Changelog.md` - Understand version history and recent changes

### Step 3: Read Core System (ForAI Priority)

1. First, read ALL files in `/core/forai/` - these are optimized for your comprehension
2. Then, read ALL files in `/core/` - these provide additional context, examples, and narrative explanations

The core documents are numbered (Document 1-16). Read them in numerical order when possible.

### Step 4: Read Extensions (ForAI Priority)

1. First, read ALL files in `/extensions/forai/`
2. Then, read ALL files in `/extensions/`

Extensions build on core rules. They do not redefine core mechanics.

### Step 5: Read Supplemental (ForAI Priority)

1. First, read ALL files in `/supplemental/forai/`
2. Then, read ALL files in `/supplemental/`

The glossary provides canonical definitions for all TDGS terms.

### Step 6: Read Global ForAI Documents

Read any remaining files in `/forai/` that weren't covered above.

## Key Concepts to Internalize

As you read, pay special attention to:

- **Resolution Target 11**: All resolution rolls target 11. Always.
- **Resolution vs Magnitude**: These are always separate. Never combined.
- **Delta Method**: Your_Stat - Their_Stat = Delta
- **The Four Ability Types**: Skills (leveled, +1 system), Spells (binary, tiered), Traits (binary, no tiers), and how they differ
- **Luck System**: Affects resolution probability, NEVER magnitude
- **Four-Layer Architecture**: Core → Extensions → Content → Game Layer
- **Engine vs Content**: What the engine defines vs what content implements

## Completion

When you have finished reading all documents, respond with:
