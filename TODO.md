## ForAI Header Standardization

~~ForAI documents use two header formats. Documents 9-15 use `# TACTICAL DICE GAME SYSTEM (TDGS) - DOCUMENT X`. Documents 3-8 and 16 use `# Title: [Name]`. These should be standardized in a future pass, likely when the ForAI docs are next revised.~~

**COMPLETED** - All ForAI documents now use the standardized header format.
