**This is a high bar. Most Core change proposals are declined. Please read CONTRIBUTING.md first.**

## Document Affected
Which Core document(s) would change?

## Current Behavior
How does it work now?

## Proposed Change
How should it work instead?

## Why This Cannot Be An Extension
Extensions extend, they never override. Why must Core itself change?

## Impact Analysis
What breaks if we make this change? What breaks if we do not?

## Backward Compatibility
Can existing implementations adapt, or is this a breaking change?
