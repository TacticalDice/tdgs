### Tactical Dice Game System Intent

In the Beginning: Intent  
Tactical Dice Game System (TDGS)

Purpose

The Tactical Dice Game System (TDGS) exists to define a foundational role playing engine, not a setting, not a genre, and not a single game.

TDGS is designed as a core upon which many different games can be built, played by humans, run by computers, or shared between the two.

It is concerned with defining how uncertainty is resolved, how capability is represented, and how outcomes are decided, without embedding assumptions about story, tone, or content.

Open by design

The core engine rules of TDGS are open source by intent and are released under the MIT License.

This is not a legal convenience. It is a design goal.

The MIT License is used to ensure that the TDGS engine:
can be freely used
can be freely modified
can be freely redistributed
can be used in commercial and non commercial projects
does not impose viral or restrictive licensing obligations

The engine exists to be read, extended, implemented, and experimented with, without requiring permission.

Encouraging creative expansion

TDGS is not meant to be owned in the traditional sense.

It is meant to be grown.

We explicitly encourage:
new games built on TDGS
adventures written for TDGS
software and tooling that implement TDGS
simulations, bots, and automated systems
experimental forks and alternate interpretations

If you build on this engine, the expectation is simple:
say that it is TDGS based.

This is a cultural expectation, not a legal barrier. The goal is clarity, not control.

If interesting things grow out of TDGS, that is success, not competition.

Why this exists

Life is hard.  
Systems are complicated.  
People are tired.

TDGS exists because sometimes you want to sit down, roll dice, and let the universe behave a little differently for a while.

Sometimes you want rules that hold together.  
Sometimes you want luck to matter.  
Sometimes you want things to go terribly wrong or unexpectedly right.

TDGS exists to put something fun into the universe, without pretending that everything is fair, simple, or safe.

Fun is not optional

TDGS is not trying to win arguments about realism, balance, or theoretical purity.

It is trying to create space for:
surprise
tension
relief
laughter
frustration that turns into stories later

If a rule is technically correct but consistently unfun, it is a bad rule.

If an edge case produces a memorable moment, that is a feature.

Core identity features of TDGS

The following features define what makes TDGS itself.  
If these are removed or fundamentally altered, the system ceases to be TDGS.

1. Clear separation of resolution and magnitude

TDGS draws a hard boundary between:
whether something happens
and how much happens

Success and failure are resolved separately from damage, duration, area, and quantity.

Luck, modifiers, and critical outcomes affect resolution.  
Magnitude is governed by stats, abilities, and explicit mechanics.

This separation is foundational.

2. Dice with explicit roles

Dice in TDGS are not interchangeable.

Each die exists for a reason:
some resolve truth
some resolve quantity
some select outcomes
some represent extremes

No die is allowed to do all of these at once.

This prevents probability from collapsing into noise as the system grows.

3. Luck as a permanent probability distortion

Luck is a defining mechanic in TDGS.

It is:
permanent
abnormal by definition
non linear
mathematically enforced
symmetric for blessing and curse

Luck is not a resource.  
It is not a reroll.  
It is not a flat modifier.

Luck represents a persistent distortion of probability, shaping how often extreme outcomes occur without replacing skill or capability.

Extraordinary fortune and extraordinary misfortune are allowed, rare, and intentional.

4. Extremes are permitted, not smoothed away

TDGS does not attempt to protect characters from the consequences of extreme states.

The system allows:
overwhelming advantage
catastrophic failure
cursed existence
improbable victory

These states are difficult to reach and difficult to escape, but they are real.

The system does not flatten the world to preserve balance.

5. Growth without hidden ceilings

There are no artificial caps on progression.

Advancement is constrained only by:
effort
survival
opportunity
circumstance

While extreme states are possible, they are not expected.

The system supports both short lived stories and generational arcs without redefining its rules.

6. Computable by design

Every core rule in TDGS is designed to be:
readable by humans
deterministic for computers
free of narrative ambiguity

A human controller may interpret outcomes.  
A computer never has to.

The same rules must function in both contexts.

A canonical TDGS game

TDGS is intended to support many games.

However, TDGS will also have a canonical game and setting developed alongside the engine.

This canonical implementation exists to:
demonstrate how TDGS can be used in practice
provide a shared reference point
offer reusable content such as bestiaries, lore, and scenarios
serve as a living example of the system under real use

The canonical game is not required to use TDGS.

No rule in the engine depends on canonical content, and TDGS remains fully usable without it.

Canon as reference, not restriction

The canonical TDGS universe is intended to be:
optional
remixable
expandable
importable

People are encouraged to:
use canon content directly
modify it
extract parts of it
ignore it entirely

Canon exists to lower the barrier to play and creation, not to constrain it.

What TDGS is not

TDGS is not:
a finished game
a genre simulator
a balance obsessed skirmish engine
a narrative only freeform framework
a collection of classes, spells, or equipment

Those belong to games built on top of TDGS.

What success looks like

TDGS is successful if:

A lucky nobody can occasionally defeat something far stronger.
A cursed hero can fail repeatedly despite competence.
A powerful being remains powerful even at low levels.
Growth feels earned rather than inevitable.
The same rules function at small and absurd scales.
People enjoy using it.

Reading the documents that follow

The documents that follow are written as specifications, not tutorials.

They define:
what is allowed
what is forbidden
what is assumed

They intentionally avoid flavor and examples until rules are complete.

Once something is defined here, everything else depends on it.

Status

This document defines the foundational intent of TDGS.

It is released under the MIT License as part of the TDGS engine specification.

Future documents build on this foundation.  
Changes here should be rare, deliberate, and backward compatible whenever possible.
